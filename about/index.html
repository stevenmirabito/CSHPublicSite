		<p>Computer Science House, founded in 1976, is one of the oldest and most active Special Interest Houses at
			Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY. Located on the third floor of the Nathaniel Rochester
			Hall dormitory, CSH provides a revolutionary living environment for over fifty on-floor students and many
			off-floor members as well.</p>

		<p>In addition to RIT's standard residence hall facilities, CSH has several unique, multi-purpose rooms, filled
			with technical and material resources for members to use. CSH's computing resources include e-mail,
			newsgroups, database and web space services, our own wired network, and a multitude of servers and
			workstations - all maintained and operated by members. Hands-on learning is emphasized in order to give
			members a significant advantage in the professional world.</p>

<p>CSH is an exciting place to live and learn. There are always fun things to do, interesting projects to work on, and
	members who are eager to lend their expertise in a wide variety of subjects. Members share a feeling of kinship,
	belonging and commitment to each other and the floor. The atmosphere on floor is equal parts academic and
	social.</p>
